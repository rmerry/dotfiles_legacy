# Richard Merry's Dot Files

1 In the beginning I provisioned GNU/Linux.

2 And the GNU/Linux installation was waste and void; and the default settings were upon the face of the environment: and my fingers moved unto the face of the keyboard.

3 And I said, Let there be dot files: and there were dot files.

4 And I saw the dot files, that they were good: and I divided the dot files into folders.
